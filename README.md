# DeezChess-CLI

This is a Chess game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, 
and it serves as my first attempt at implementing OOP concepts. You can play the game via 
the Command Line Interface (CLI) by running the `main.exe` file.

The project aims to provide a strong foundation for building a chess engine in the future.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a Windows environment or an emulator capable of running `.exe` files.

### Running the Game
1. Download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the game by executing:
   ```
   main.exe
   ```

## Features
- Full chess game simulation with standard rules.
- CLI-based interface for an authentic experience.
- Beginner-friendly implementation using OOP principles.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing a chess engine for AI-based gameplay.
- Adding save and load game functionality.
- Introducing a graphical user interface (GUI) version.

## Suggestions
- Consider refining the code structure to further optimize OOP practices as you progress.
- Explore different algorithms for implementing a chess engine, such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.
